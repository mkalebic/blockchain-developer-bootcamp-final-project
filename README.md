# ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 
## Final Project Idea 
In short, I'd like to create generative art NFT's that are modified using publicly available oracle data from Chainlink.   One simple example could be having a parameter that's modified based on weather conditions from the [Google Weather Oracle](https://docs.chain.link/docs/google-weather/) for a given set of coordinates.  

## Why? 
We're all monitoring information on-chain to make decisions. It's neat to think about having to monitor a process IRL (i.e. whether it's raining in Toronto) instead. As a data scientist, I'm also fascinated by how to manage on-chain and off-chain compute + how Chainlink 2.0's vision of hybrid smart contracts will change the current development landscape. 

This will hopefully be a simple project idea that gives me a bunch of starting points for more advanced work.
